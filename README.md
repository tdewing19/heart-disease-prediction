This is a machine learning project aimed at developing a classification model that best predicts whether or not a patient will develop heart disease based on demographic information and various risk factors, including age, sex, occupation type, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status.

The **[report](https://github.com/tdewing19/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Prediction.pdf)** outlines the entire modeling process, from data cleaning to model training to final model evaluation. Some of the models trained include logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost. Source code in R is also included for the models.
